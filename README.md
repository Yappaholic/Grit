# Grit: a package manager for Cave linux (WIP)
-------------------------------------------

This is a work in progress, so many features and functionality to come.

The idea behind Grit is to be as easy to use as `npm` (Node Package Manager), at
the same time providing sane ways to install, update, search and remove
packages.

Configs for packages are written in the similar fashion to Gentoo ebuild, but
more simple in nature.

The whole project is inspired from `Linux From Scratch` as an attempt to create
my own package manager solution for everyday usage.
